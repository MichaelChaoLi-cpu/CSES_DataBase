# CSES Database

This repository owns the reproducible ingestion, alignment, validation, publication, and lineage
workflow for the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES) in the `mda` PostgreSQL database.

The project separates four kinds of state:

- Git owns code, tests, mapping specifications, and documentation under `rsc/` and `docs/`.
- DVC owns source archives and reproducible data artifacts under `data/`, plus runtime settings under
  `etc/`.
- PostgreSQL owns the current transactional catalog, approved mappings, load history, and published
  analytical relations.
- Database backups remain external recovery artifacts and are not substitutes for Git or DVC.

## Current status

The raw archive set matches the eleven CSES archives used by the earlier `MJ02b` database work. This
repository now reproduces and validates the seven core local table artifacts. After normalizing the
intentional raw-path change, every local table matches the earlier Parquet release value for value.

The v1 functional-schema migration is complete in `mda`: 22 physical CSES relations now reside in
`cses_data`, `cses_alignment`, or `cses_analysis`; seven normalized management tables reside in
`cses_meta`; and exact-name `public` compatibility views preserve the existing query interface. The
migration used a verified external backup and passed preflight, postflight, physical-identity, reader,
and local-baseline validation.

The reviewed baseline metadata release is also imported: `cses_meta` records 10 surveys, 11 source
archives, 171 physical datasets, 22 storage relations, 62 direct dataset-output edges, one alignment
release, and one adoption load run. An independent read-only validation reconciles all 278 records to
no-ops. The next implementation milestone is the deterministic lineage-graph export.
